Ruta Binkyte is a doctoral Machine Learning Ethics researcher at Inria Saclay-Ile-de-France, LIX École Polytechnique and IP Paris. She has a diverse background in cultural anthropology, history, and data science which she leverages to address the complex interdisciplinary questions in ethical ML. 

Her Ph.D. work at the Institute Polytechnique de Paris, funded by the ERC Hypatia grant, is at the intersection of fairness, privacy, and causality and investigates practical and theoretical tools for developing ethical machine learning implementations.

Her research was featured in a keynote talk at FLoC and CSF or is forthcoming in peer-reviewed journals, including EURO Journal on Decision Processes. She has co-designed (with Sami Zhioua) and teaches the course on ML Fairness at Aivancity, an interdisciplinary AI and business school in Paris. She is an author of learning material on Algorithmic Media (a project in partnership with NGO Meno Avilys and British Council Lithuania) for high school children and a Data Science coach (in collaboration with Teachers Lead Tech) for primary schools in Lithuania.

She has contributed to various research projects and initiatives, including co-organizing (with Bilel Benbouzid) the Interdisciplinary Workshop on Fairness in AI, bringing together more than 50 researchers from social sciences, computer sciences, and legal studies, and AI Ethics Workshop at LIX, École Polytechnique. She also holds a Google WTM Scholar Award for 2020-2021.
